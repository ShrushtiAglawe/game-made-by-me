A simple Flappy Bird game developed in Python using the Pygame library. The game features gravity-based bird movement, user-controlled flapping, randomly generated pipes, collision detection, scoring system, and restart functionality. This project demonstrates core game development concepts and event handling in Python

Project Title

Flappy Bird Game using Python

Project Description

This project is a simple 2D Flappy Bird game developed using Python and the Pygame library. The player controls a bird that continuously falls due to gravity and must avoid colliding with moving pipes by flapping upward at the right time. The game includes real-time animation, collision detection, score tracking, and a restart option after game over.

Why I Made This Project

I made this project to understand the basics of game development and to apply Python programming concepts in a practical way. While learning Python, I wanted to build something interactive rather than only writing logic-based programs. This project helped me learn how real-time programs work, how user input is handled, and how graphics and animations are created using code.
It also helped me improve my problem-solving skills by breaking the game into small components like bird movement, pipe generation, collision detection, and scoring.

How the Project Works

The bird moves continuously due to gravity.
When the user presses the space bar or clicks the mouse, the bird flaps upward.
Pipes are generated at random heights and move from right to left.
If the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, the game ends.
The score increases each time the bird successfully passes a pipe.
The game can be restarted after a game over.


What I Learned

Through this project, I learned about game loops, event handling, object-oriented programming, collision detection, and basic physics concepts like gravity. It also improved my understanding of how Python can be used beyond simple scripts to build interactive applications.
